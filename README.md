## Problem & Background
<li>The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak caused by SARS-2 is a human to human spread virus that has caused major health and safety concerns resulting in social restrictions that may have affected people’s nutrition and exercise behaviors.</li>  
<li>Having a healthy lifestyle that involves a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and participating in frequent exercise can protect against certain diseases and strengthen a person's immune system.</li>
<li>Exercise is shown to have a positive effect on physical and psychological well-being when completed regularly.</li>

## Goal
<li>The goal of this project is to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic relates to adults’ perceived diet and exercise habits in the U.S.</li>

## Data Collection and Analysis
<li>Method for data collection was posting the survey to three different social media platforms.</li>
The survey questions were analyzed for:
<li>Perceived differences in consumption of nutritionally dense foods compared to high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) foods pre-COVID-19 pandemic vs. during the pandemic.</li>
<li>Perceived differences in type and frequency of exercise pre-COVID-19 pandemic vs. during the pandemic.</li>
<Li>Perceived motivators and barriers to adults’ nutrition and exercise habits during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>

## Discussion & Conclusion
<li>The majority of adults that participated in exercise during the pandemic reported higher frequency of at home and outdoor workouts than before the pandemic.</li>
<li>Approximately one third of participants reported exercising less frequently than pre-pandemic.</li>
<li>The majority of participants reported they perceived that their consumption of nutritionally dense foods did not change.</li>
<li>Two fifths of participants reported they perceived that they consumed more high fat, salt, and sugar (HFSS) foods than pre-pandemic.</li>
